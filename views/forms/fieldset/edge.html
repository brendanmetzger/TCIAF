    <p>A graph in the sense of data visualization is a tool capable of describing the relationships between objects as a two-dimensional drawing: vertices (the dots in the example) represent individual items and edges (the lines) represent relationships between them. All of TCF's data—persons, features, organizations—are represested individually as a vertex. Vertices are connected to one another by choosing an edge type and searching for another vertex to attach. It is important to note that the system becomes is more powerful with <em>more edges</em>, as opposed to a more traditional database which requires new and unique fields to store extra information. An advantage to graphs here is you can describe topics in ever-changing ways without extraneous fields or duplication of data. Another advantage is that when looking at any vertex, you can know everything about it by following the edges.</p>
